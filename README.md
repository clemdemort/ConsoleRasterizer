# ConsoleRasterizer
note: this only works on windows(using windows.h)
here is how you can use my application:
 
when you'll launch the application you will most likely come acros some weird glitches, this is normal, your console isnt set up properly for it, so let's do that!
  
 1/ First off we are going to right click the top of the console which should make a litle menu scroll down, from here we will click on properties.

2/ From there you'll have access to a bunch of options, but we will only look at "Fonts" next we scroll down until we find "Raster Fonts", Finally we select he "8x8" size.

3/the setup is now done and the console should look a bit like this, if not, try to scale it up a bit and it should work!
