# ConsoleRasterizer
note: this only works on windows(using windows.h)

here is how you can use my application:

First, build the application.

Then, when you'll launch the application you will most likely come across some weird glitches, this is normal, your console isn't set up properly for it, so let's do that!
  
 1/ First off we are going to right click the top of the console which should make a litle menu scroll down, from here we will click on properties.

2/ From there you'll have access to a bunch of options, but we will only look at "Fonts" next we scroll down until we find "Raster Fonts", Finally we select the "8x8" size and click "OK".

3/ The setup is now done and the console should look a bit like this, if not, try to scale it up a bit and it should work!
